4) Your task is to
• write a function that computes the maximum value among the deviations of all the sequences considered above
• print the value the standard output (stdout)
Note that your function will receive the following arguments:
• v
o which is the array of integers
• d
o which is an integer value giving the length of the sequences
Data constraints
• the array will contain up to 100,000 elements
• all the elements in the array are integer numbers in the following range: [1, 231 -1]
• the value of d will not exceed the length of the given array
Efficiency constraints
• your function is expected to print the result in less than 2 seconds
Input                 Output
v: 6, 9, 4, 7, 4, 1
d: 3                    6

The sequences of length 3 are:
• 6 9 4 having the median 5 (the minimum value in the sequence is 4 and the maximum is 9)
• 9 4 7 having the median 5 (the minimum value in the sequence is 4 and the maximum is 9)
• 7 4 1 having the median 6 (the minimum value in the sequence is 1 and the maximum is 7)
• The maximum value among all medians is 6
def find_deviation(v, d)
    # Write your code here
    # To print results to the standard output you can use puts
    # Example puts "Hello world!"

end

5) Given an array of integer elements, a subsequence of this array is a set of consecutive elements from the array (i.e: given the array v: [7, 8, -3, 5, -1], a subsequence of v is 8, -3, 5)
Your task is to
• write a function that finds a left and a right subsequence of the array that satisfy the following conditions
o the two subsequences are unique (they don't have shared elements)
o the difference between the sum of the elements in the right subsequence and the sum of the elements in the left subsequence is maximum
• print the difference to the standard output (stdout)
Note that your function will receive the following arguments:
• v
o which is the array of integers
Data constraints
• the array has at least 2 and at most 1,000,000 numbers
• all the elements in the array are integer numbers in the following range: [-1000, 1000]
Efficiency constraints
• your function is expected to print the result in less than 2 seconds

Input                                 Output
v: 3, -5, 1, -2, 8, -2, 3, -2, 1        15
Explanation
The left sequence is : -5, 1, -2 and the right sequence is: 8, -2, 3.
