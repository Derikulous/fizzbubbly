# Recreate the classic fizzbuzz challenge

### Created in Ruby with the following stipulations:
Write a method that takes one number as an argument. For multiples of three return “Fizz”, and for the multiples of five return “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five return “FizzBuzz”, and in all other cases return the number.

### Now create a new solution that is extensible:

Our users request that numbers that are multiples of seven will result in a "Sivv". Actually, they have a list of 30 other numbers they'd like this program to handle.

Make a second fizzbuzz program that will handle this kind of extensibility.
